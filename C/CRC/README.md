This is my personal project. It is a minimalistic C compiler that turns
C code into RISC-V assembly. Special java executable file is provided,
which will simulate running the compiled c program. Of course, writing
a full C compiler is quite difficult and might take years, this is why 
my C compiler will be very limited from the start and will possibly 
have kind of extensions that standard GCC compiler does not support.
Compiler will be implemented in C using input/output stream libraries. 

I will update my compiler slowly and write about what has been updated
here. Starting from now: 

1) Initial commit: created simple input - output files and added 
venus.jar to the directory with addition to a C file, in which, compiler 
will be implemented.
