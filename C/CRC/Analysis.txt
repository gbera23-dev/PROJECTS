Once the variable is declared in the stack, it 
could be referenced at some point in the scope, so we need separate structure where we will store information
(information will be a variable type and name of the variable, both char*, so 8 bytes). There is currently no
other reason to maintain the information of anything else. All the data we have in the C program is in the
declared variable. We will just create a kind of a data structure, that will maintain declared variable names
and types. And allow us to store, find, retrieve and delete information fast enough. For this, I will use my 
own generic structure I wrote in one of the assignments of the paradigms. I do not, at first, care about 
efficiency, so I will use my vector. I htink there is no need to create separate module for this, Mr_Assembler will take care of it! 
However, it has to be noted that Data.c will not use our vector, because it is a static memory, its size never changes, 
it will be a block of memory allocated on the heap and cleaned
after program ends, I will declare constant variables for number of tokens and create a array of char*'s, which
will be stored in the heap. This is the first thing I will start writing. I will just have a struct which defines
a type, that is the name of the type with the int(amount of bytes needed to declare this type). and that struct
will be stored in my static array. The whole purpose of Data.c and Data.h files will be to have a "static" 
function that will generate this static array in heap and return the pointer to it. So I need Type struct and
definition of init function in the Data.h. Data.c will be implemented now. 

We add additional c files that have _test after name and before .c. They will be used for testing purposes, BUT
will be removed when project is ready. test files will allow us to be confident that implementations of our
functions are valid and sound
