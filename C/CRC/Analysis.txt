Once the variable is declared in the stack, it 
could be referenced at some point in the scope, so we need separate structure where we will store information
(information will be a variable type and name of the variable, both char*, so 8 bytes). There is currently no
other reason to maintain the information of anything else. All the data we have in the C program is in the
declared variable. We will just create a kind of a data structure, that will maintain declared variable names
and types. And allow us to store, find, retrieve and delete information fast enough. For this, I will use my 
own generic structure I wrote in one of the assignments of the paradigms. I do not, at first, care about 
efficiency, so I will use my vector. I htink there is no need to create separate module for this, Mr_Assembler will take care of it! 
However, it has to be noted that Data.c will not use our vector, because it is a static memory, its size never changes, 
it will be a block of memory allocated on the heap and cleaned
after program ends, I will declare constant variables for number of tokens and create a array of char*'s, which
will be stored in the heap. This is the first thing I will start writing. I will just have a struct which defines
a type, that is the name of the type with the int(amount of bytes needed to declare this type). and that struct
will be stored in my static array. The whole purpose of Data.c and Data.h files will be to have a "static" 
function that will generate this static array in heap and return the pointer to it. So I need Type struct and
definition of init function in the Data.h. Data.c will be implemented now. 

We add additional c files that have _test after name and before .c. They will be used for testing purposes, BUT
will be removed when project is ready. test files will allow us to be confident that implementations of our
functions are valid and sound. 

Now, we shall start making the Mr_Assembler's life harder. We need to think about what attributes
does Mr_Assembler need to maintain. Since initially all we have are variable declarations and
operations. We need to store variable names and also store pointer to a Data to understand 
whether we have new variable declaration or do we have operation on already existing variable. 

Mr_Assember will use instructions module, to generate elementary instructions for tokens.
We currently have support for variables of size 4 and 1(float cannot be loaded in the register
and this has to be figured out how to do it properly) and we have simple type declaration of 
the variable(e.g int x;), assignment of the variable (e.g y = 3; or int z = 5;), and printing
of the variable(custom function different from C's printf(will probably add printf later)). 
This all has to be implemented(we have to implement Mr_Assembler's functions). Then, for the
future, we will figure out how to use operators like(+, *, (, ), /) on variables and blend them
with already defined instructions. 

Before we delve in implementing Mr_Assembler. We need one more module and one extra function in CRC.c. 

We need stringTokenizer module(and I will implement it) and also CRC.c must be able to trim each command, before passing
all the commands to hands of Mr_Assembler. 

I just found strtok function of c and it is very very good in doing what I want, it removes all the problems, but cleaning
strings before passing them to strtok is still hygienic and necessary. I will heavily depend on this function during 
implementation of Mr_Assembler, which I will soon start. 

I have done two things: 

I have cleaned each token fully and discover strtok that will be used to further tokenize each token. Now, I will create new
strVector in main and pass it to Mr_Assembler, then implement the main and initial functionality of Mr_Assember.
